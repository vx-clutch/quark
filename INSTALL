Quick Installation Guide for quark lib
======================================

There are two main ways to build quark depending on your usage
case: System-wide, and locally. System-wide would allow any
C source files to access the functionality of the library,
and locally, which would allow you to use for a single
project, or just test out the functionality.


Build Prerequisites
-------------------

The only binarys needed to build quark are GNU Make and a
C11 or newer compiler.

The system used to build quark does not need to be
Linux-based, however it has only be tested on such.


Build and Installation Procedure
--------------------------------

To build and install quark:

 1. Run the provided configure script from the top-level source
    directory

 2. Run "make" to compile.

 3. Optionally, run "make install" with appropriate privileges
    to write to the target location.

Notes on Linking
------------------------

If you want to compile with quark lib you need to link
with "-lq", as long as it was installed system-wide.
